Sure! Here's a simple GitHub Actions example showing how to use jobs.<job_id>.outputs to create and 
pass outputs between jobs using a dependency (needs:).

üõ†Ô∏è Goal:
One job (job_a) creates some output (e.g., a version number).

Another job (job_b) runs after job_a and uses that output.

üìÑ Example Workflow: .github/workflows/output-example.yml

name: Job Outputs Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  job_a:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      app_version: ${{ steps.get_version.outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - id: get_version
        run: echo "version=1.2.3" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  job_b:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job_a
    steps:
      - run: echo "Using version ${{ needs.job_a.outputs.app_version }}"
üîç How It Works:
job_a:

Runs a step that outputs version=1.2.3.

This is captured using the step ID get_version and assigned to the job's outputs.

job_b:

Depends on job_a (needs: job_a).

Accesses the output with: needs.job_a.outputs.app_version.
