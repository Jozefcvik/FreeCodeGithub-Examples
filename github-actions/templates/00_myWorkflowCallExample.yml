🔁 workflow_call in GitHub Actions
The workflow_call trigger allows one workflow to be reused by another workflow. 
It's a key part of creating reusable workflows, enabling modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) CI/CD pipelines.

📌 Definition
A workflow using workflow_call is not triggered by an event like push or pull_request, 
but by another workflow via uses:.

📄 Example: Reusable Workflow (.github/workflows/reusable.yml)


name: Reusable Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      username:
        required: true
        type: string
      environment:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: "dev"
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET:
        required: true

jobs:
  print-info:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello ${{ inputs.username }} in ${{ inputs.environment }}"
      - run: echo "Secret is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}"
📌 Usage
You can call the above reusable workflow from another workflow using uses:.



📄 Example: Caller Workflow (.github/workflows/caller.yml)

name: Caller Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-reusable:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
    with:
      username: johndoe
      environment: prod
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}

You can also reference a workflow from another repository using:
uses: user/repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@main

✅ Benefits
Reusability across multiple workflows/repos
Centralized logic for common CI/CD tasks
Easier maintenance and scalability

⚠️ Notes
Reusable workflows must be stored in the .github/workflows/ directory.
Inputs can be string, boolean, or number.
Secrets must be explicitly passed — they are not inherited.
